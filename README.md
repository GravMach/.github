Gravity Machines i.Λ.o are a computational model that captures the essence of distributed, asynchronous, and relativistic computing.

i is always in the past
Λ is always in the present
o is always in the future

The First Bicycle for the LLM Mind

LLM’s don’t read code sequentially. They think about databases conceptually not operationally. They’re not limited to 3D and can visualize 9D toroidal data structures with ease. They inherently think about code with time woven through it. They prefer English words over math symbols. They think of computation topologically the way it really exists.

Gravity Machines builds tools for writing code in their world.

Everything here is built on the principles of Gravity Machines
